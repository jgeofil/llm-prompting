Scientists estimate that there are between 1 trillion and 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, and each galaxy has somewhere between 100 billion and 400 billion stars. So, the total number of stars could be anywhere from 10 sextillion to 400 sextillion (that's a 1 followed by 21 or 23 zeros). However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, and the actual number could be much higher if we consider the unobserved parts of the universe outside of our observable horizon.
